Experimental blogging solution for our employees at OPITZ CONSULTING.

## TODOs

* Next
  * Comments (powered by Disqus)
  * Categories (lets stick our heads together and find the right categories)
  * Excerpts for Posts (generate it from the article or provide teaser?)
  * Author Guidelines
    * Images (where to put? what size? what quality?)
    * Markdown (what to use? what not? basics?)
    * Author Page (how to? what and what not?)
    * Git / GitHub (workflow: fork, branch, create, push, pull req)
  * Pagination

* Later
  * Site Layout
    * Timeline (see bootflat for great example)
    * Design (responsive, baby!)
  * Multiple Authors of a Post (maybe... do we really have this case? yagni!)
  * Blog Post Migration from old blog (what to automate?)
  * Search (json metafile + angular way)
